# Real-Time Women Safety Incident Map (Unique Project Idea)

## Project Overview
Build a real-time web application that displays women safety incidents on a live map. The app fetches and visualizes incident data as it happens, allowing users to see trends, hotspots, and recent reports. This project uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a public API or simulated real-time data.

## Features
- **Live Map Visualization:** Incidents appear as pins or heatmaps on a city map.
- **Real-Time Updates:** New incidents are fetched and displayed instantly (using WebSockets, polling, or simulated data).
- **Filtering:** Users can filter by city, type of incident, or time range.
- **Statistics Panel:** Shows live summary stats (totals, trends, recent activity).
- **Mobile Responsive:** Works on desktop and mobile.

## Tech Stack
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla or with frameworks)
- [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/) for interactive maps
- [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) or polling for real-time updates
- Chart.js for live charts
- (Optional) Node.js backend for real data streaming

## How It Works
1. **Frontend:**
   - Loads a map centered on a city/region
   - Fetches incident data from an API or mock server
   - Updates map and charts in real time
2. **Backend (Optional):**
   - Provides a WebSocket or REST API endpoint for incident data
   - Simulates or relays real-time incident reports

## Getting Started
1. Clone or download this folder.
2. Install dependencies (if using Node.js backend).
3. Open `realtime_index.html` in your browser to see the live map and dashboard.

## Extensions
- Integrate with real open data APIs (e.g., city police feeds)
- Add user reporting (submit new incidents)
- SMS/email alerts for new incidents in selected areas
